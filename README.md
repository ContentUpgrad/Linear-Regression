As you can see there are three main folders when you log in:

1. **Industry Relevance of Linear Regression** This is where all the code files regarding Industry Relevance of Linear Regression sessions are kept
2. **Multiple Linear Regression in Python** This is where all the code files regarding Multiple Linear Regression in Python session are kept
3. **Simple Linear Regression in Python**This is where all the code files regarding Simple Linear Regression in Python session are kept

When you click on any folder you will find the code and data folders as shown below:
